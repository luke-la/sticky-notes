# Sticky Notes
Sticky Notes is a visual organization tool that runs in the browser and saves to your local storage so no sign in is required.

## Description
Users of this program can create sticky notes, drag them around the screen, click to edit their contents, and use a button to mark them as favorites and have them stand out.

The different types of notes include text notes (a standard sticky note), list notes with checkboxes, and image notes (which link to a web-hosted image).

Multiple boards can be created and subsequently accessed using the menu in the top left corner of the screen. These boards can be downloaded as JSON files and reimported later, renamed, or deleted.

A settings menu is available for customizing the site's appearance, enabling a grid for the notes to snap to, and other options.

## About the Project
### Using the Program
The easiest way to view the site is via [Github Pages](https://luke-la.github.io/sticky-notes/).

Alternately, you may follow these steps to run it locally:
1. Download a .ZIP file of the repo
2. Extract the files to a folder you will be able to easily find
3. Open index.html in your favorite web browser (On Windows: open the browser and press `Ctrl+O` or double click on the file from your file explorer)

**Important**: Notes created while running the project locally will not be accessible on the site without exporting and vice versa as running the application locally accesses a different local storage.

### Contributions
Contributions are welcome if they improve existing functionality or add features based on the update plans section, but are not being requested given the limited size and complexity of the project.
